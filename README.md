### India, China, and the Philippines are the top three sources of Study Permit and Foreign Work Permit holders in Canada from 2015 to 2022. I’m going to take a look at these 3 countries and their immigration trends. Those three countries alone have a combined total of 1,760,496 citizens with either a study or foreign work permit in Canada. That is 51.32% of the total number of foreign students and workers in Canada. That’s why I got curious and wanted to find out the stories behind the data. 

The data I used here are from the Canadian Government <a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/360024f2-17e9-4558-bfc1-3616485d65b9"> website </a>  so I am pretty sure that these are reliable. 

If you want to play around with the Looker dashboard that I made for this you can access it <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/6b64420c-d537-412d-9ea1-947e980344a4"> here. </a>

### First off, my home country, the Philippines.

In 2015 the Philippines saw a record high of 23.7k Filipinos given Foreign Work Permits in Canada. This can be attributed to the <a href="https://www.dole.gov.ph/news/canada-offers-jobs-and-permanent-residency-through-its-express-entry-and-nova-scotias-regional-labor-market-demand-stream/"> aggressive campaign of the Canadian government </a> to fill job vacancies. In 2014 Canada gave birth to the “Express Entry” program. The "Express Entry" program is a fast and flexible model for economic migration, inviting candidates with a valid job offer or nomination to apply for permanent residency. Nova Scotia also introduced the New Nominee Program - Regional Labor Market Demand Stream selects individuals who meet the labor market needs, intend to pursue employment in an "in demand" occupation, and wish to live in Nova Scotia. 

These opportunities and the continuously declining economy of the Philippines encouraged the 23.7k Filipinos to try their luck in Canada and provide a better life for their family. 

During 2016, there was a decline in Filipinos obtaining foreign work permits in Canada. This could be attributed in part to the strong economy of the Philippines during that period. While Canada's GDP growth rate was at a low of 0.3% in 2015 and peaked at 3.04% in 2017 before slowing down in the following two years, the Philippines was experiencing a boom, as per data from Macrotrends. The platform indicates that from 2015 to 2019, the Filipino GDP growth rate ranged between 6.12% and 7.15% annually, which is more than double the growth rate of the Canadian economy. Therefore, there was a greater availability of job opportunities in the Philippines during those years, which could have contributed to the decrease in Filipinos seeking work abroad in Canada.
